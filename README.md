# MyWallet
Software engineering project of an algorithmic trading app.
# About the project
My Wallet is a platform for the automated managing of the wallet of the user.
The user can  register to the platform and create an account and upload some money. He can manage his account details and his personal information.
He can buy and sell stocks and visualize how his assets are allocated, thanks to a simple user interface. 
But what makes MyWallet special is the fact that an algorithm that uses ARMA models for time series analysis sends automatically a notification to the user,
every time it finds a good investment or everytime it determines that a stock should be sold. With just a click the user can approve the transaction.
The software constantly monitors the market and automatically makes every analysis. Moreover, the platform allows the user to set some parameters (risks, long term or short term investments, etc), so the software notifies different stocks based on the user profile
